#  BlahBlah Aka Chitter Challenge
**Makers Academy - Weekend Challenge 4**

## Task

This was a weekend challenge where I was tasked to build a small lightweight twitter clone in Ruby.

## Aim
My main focus for this project was to cement my knowledge gained during the week. As always, I approached this project in a test driven manner which allowed me to build my project with confidence when adding new features.

## Reflection

**19/03/18**
I found that I began to get a good flow of how to approach implementing new features. I would first start with my feature tests, then implement the visual side of the feature. I would then to begin to write my logic tests and then finally implement the logic required for the feature to work.

**Difficulties:** I hadn't come across implementing an authentication system as of yet, therefore I felt that this was probably the most difficult part of the project. I also should of that I should have the database column names (blahs) should of have been named more suitably (posts).

**28/04/18**
I came back to this code after completing the [acebook-pinkfish](acebook-pinkfish) group project. I felt this project gave me more of a understanding to what was happening behind the scenes when working with Ruby on Rails.

Having built this project from the ground up, The existing structure of the code allowed me to easily implement a few more features to this repo such as deleting blahs(posts).

I also gained more of an understanding towards restful routing and the use of multiple controllers for a project.
